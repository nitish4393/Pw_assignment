Q1. Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop.
For Loop:

A for loop is typically used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string).
Example: Iterating over a list of numbers to print each number.
python

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
While Loop:

A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known and depends on a condition.
Example: Printing numbers from 1 to 5 until a condition is met.
python
Copy code
num = 1
while num <= 5:
    print(num)
    num += 1
Q2. Write a Python program to print the sum and product of the first 10 natural numbers using for and while loops.
Using For Loop:

python

# Sum and product using for loop
sum_for = 0
product_for = 1
for i in range(1, 11):
    sum_for += i
    product_for *= i

print(f"Sum using for loop: {sum_for}")
print(f"Product using for loop: {product_for}")
Using While Loop:

python

# Sum and product using while loop
sum_while = 0
product_while = 1
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    sum_while += i
    product_while *= i
    i += 1

print(f"Sum using while loop: {sum_while}")
print(f"Product using while loop: {product_while}")
Q3. Create a Python program to compute the electricity bill for a household.
python
Copy code
units = int(input("Enter the units of electricity consumed in a month: "))
bill = 0

if units <= 100:
    bill = units * 4.5
elif units <= 200:
    bill = (100 * 4.5) + ((units - 100) * 6)
elif units <= 300:
    bill = (100 * 4.5) + (100 * 6) + ((units - 200) * 10)
else:
    bill = (100 * 4.5) + (100 * 6) + (100 * 10) + ((units - 300) * 20)

print(f"The total electricity bill is: Rs. {bill}")
Q4. Create a list of numbers from 1 to 100 and calculate the cube of each number, appending numbers whose cubes are divisible by 4 or 5 to a list.
python

numbers = list(range(1, 101))
result = []

# Using for loop
for num in numbers:
    cube = num ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result.append(num)

print("Using for loop:", result)

# Using while loop
i = 1
result_while = []
while i <= 100:
    cube = i ** 3
    if cube % 4 == 0 or cube % 5 == 0:
        result_while.append(i)
    i += 1

print("Using while loop:", result_while)
Q5. Write a program to filter and count vowels in the given string.
python

string = "I want to become a data scientist"
vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
vowel_count = 0

for char in string:
    if char in vowels:
        vowel_count += 1

print(f"Number of vowels in the string: {vowel_count}")
